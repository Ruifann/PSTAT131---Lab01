# Define supervised and unsupervised learning. What are the difference(s) between them?
```


```{r}
# Supervised learning is a machine learning approach that’s defined by its use of labeled datasets. Supervised learning can be separated into two types of problems when data mining: classification and regression.
# Unsupervised learning uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled data sets. Unsupervised learning models are used for three main tasks: clustering, association and dimensionality reduction.
# The difference between superviced learning and unsuperviced learning is that supervised learning uses labeled input and output data, while an unsupervised learning algorithm does not.

```{r}
# Explain the difference between a regression model and a classification model, specifically in the context of machine learning.
# The main difference between regression model and classification model is the data type of Y.
# In a regression model, Y is quantitative and numerical values such as price and blood preesure.
# In a classification model. Y is a qualitative and categorical values such as married/ not married.

# As discussed, statistical models can be used for different purposes. These purposes can generally be classified into the following three categories. Provide a brief description of each.

# Descriptive models: Choose model to best visually emphasize a trend in data

# Inferential models: often used to compare the differences between the treatment groups and aim is to test theories such as causal claims State relationship between outcome and predictor

# Predictive models: predict future behavior and aim is to predict Y with minimum reducible error

```{r}
#Predictive models are frequently used in machine learning, and they can usually be described as either mechanistic or empirically-driven. Answer the following questions.

#Define mechanistic. Define empirically-driven. How do these model types differ? How are they similar?

#In general, is a mechanistic or empirically-driven model easier to understand? Explain your choice.

#Describe how the bias-variance tradeoff is related to the use of mechanistic or empirically-driven models.

A political candidate’s campaign has collected some detailed voter history data from their constituents. The campaign is interested in two questions:

Given a voter’s profile/data, how likely is it that they will vote in favor of the candidate?

How would a voter’s likelihood of support for the candidate change if they had personal contact with the candidate?

Classify each question as either predictive or inferential. Explain your reasoning for each.
